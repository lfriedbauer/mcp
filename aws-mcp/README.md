# MCP Tools Collection

A comprehensive collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that enhance AI assistants with powerful tool integrations and AWS service capabilities.

## What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that enables secure connections between AI applications and external data sources and tools. Think of it as a bridge that allows your AI assistant to interact with databases, APIs, cloud services, and other external systems in a standardized way.

### How MCP Works

1. **MCP Client**: Your AI assistant (like Claude, Cursor, or Amazon Q CLI)
2. **MCP Server**: Specialized tools that provide specific capabilities
3. **Protocol**: Standardized communication between client and server

```

### Benefits of MCP

- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Give your AI assistant access to real-time data and services
- **Standardized Integration**: One protocol for connecting to many different tools
- **Security**: Controlled access with proper authentication and permissions
- **Flexibility**: Mix and match different MCP servers based on your needs

3. **Add to your MCP client** configuration file
4. **Start using** with natural language commands

### Step 3: Basic Usage

Once configured, you can interact with tools using natural language:

```
"List all my database tables"
"Create a new S3 bucket for my project"
"Show me the cost breakdown for this month"
"Generate a diagram of my current architecture"
```
