# Tools Directory

This folder is reserved for future MCP tools that you add to your collection. Each new tool should get its own subfolder here.

## 🚀 Adding New Tools

When you discover a new MCP tool you want to try:

1. **Create a new folder** with a descriptive name
2. **Add a README.md** explaining what the tool does
3. **Include setup instructions** specific to that tool
4. **Add configuration examples** in the tool's folder
5. **Test thoroughly** before relying on it

## 📁 Recommended Structure

```
